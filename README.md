# Rock-Paper-Scissorcs-Lizard-Spock
This project is a GUI game that is a variation of the popular game Rock-Paper-Scissors, called Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. This version of the game is more complex and involves five symbols. The gameplay works such that each round, the player and computer select a symbol from the five available options. The winner is determined based on the rules of the game, which are displayed in the interface.

The game interface is designed using JavaFX and includes a "game board" where both the player's and computer's chosen symbols are displayed. The computer's symbol is determined using the Java Random class each time the player selects their symbol.

The game involves different outcomes for each possible combination of symbols, as shown by the arrows in the image provided. For example, Scissors defeats Paper and Lizard, while Lizard is defeated by both Scissors and Rock.
